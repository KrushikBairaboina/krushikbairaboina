                <h2>1. Opinions and recommendations</h2>
                <p>These are posts on a particular topic around software development that are mostly inspired by your opinions and thoughts.

                   <br> Take a look at the programming languages you use, or the tools, frameworks and technologies you’re involved with. It’s likely several of these topics are a source of discourse within the software development community. 
                    
                   <br> Regardless of whether there is a consensus on the topic or not, could you provide your view on it? Formulate your thoughts on such topics into words and turn it into a blog post! </p>

                <p>We all go through common and individual struggles in our own journeys. Reflect and share what those struggles were and provide tips on how you overcame them.

                   <br> Topics on challenges faced by programmers can include: feeling a lack of progress, feeling like quitting, the struggles of job hunting, imposter syndrome and all other various struggles we face.
                    
                   <br> If you’re presently going through challenges all the more reason to write about it! You can also get engagement from others going through the same and exchange your experiences.</p>

                <h2>3. Complete program tutorials</h2>
                <p>
                    Developers write code, so what better source of a topic to get ideas from than the programs you’ve written.

<br>A blog post on a complete program tutorial is centred on taking a working program and breaking it down to an explanation of how it works to allow someone to understand how the program was put together.

<br>These types of blog posts are a great way to exchange technical knowledge and provide other developers with practical working applications as a reference for their own projects.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Code snippets</h2>
                <p>These are a lighter form of a complete program tutorial and are instead focused on explaining how a particular function or concept works.  

                   <br> Typically, such posts are structured by sharing a piece of code that does something specific. Then the blog post can explain what that snippet of code is doing.
                    
                   <br> You can write a blog post just for the purposes of sharing snippets of code to allow anyone to copy and use it for their projects. Such posts can even be made for entertainment purposes to share something fun you created.
                    
                  <br>  Depending on the type of code being shared, a great way to present a code snippet is through a live illustration on the blog post itself. This can be gone by creating for example, a CodePen of the code snippet and embedding it on your blog post.</p>

                <h2>5. Your field of speciality</h2>
                <p>It’s likely many blog post ideas for developers will source from experiences working in a particular field in software development. If you have a speciality area then take that as your gold mine for topics to write about.

                  <br>  Starting with an area you’re familiar with can also make it easier to write about as you’re talking about a topic you already some decent knowledge about.
                    
                   <br> In my case, my field is the embedded industry so several of the blog posts on this site are inspired by  specific topics on embedded systems.</p>
